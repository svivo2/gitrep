* Timing / Code analysis questions (Lab 4)
  - dividing by 2 or multiplying by 2 can mean O(log base 2(N))
* Bubble sort AND Selection sort (choose)
  - optimizations for Bubble sort
    - inner for loop run n - 1 - i
      - the largest number will be place at the end after each pass over the array
    - no swaps = already sorted
      - inversion true / false
* Binary search
  - optimizations
* Linked List, Stacks, Queues
* Know how to use stack for postfix, infix to postfix
* Know % and / (integer division)
